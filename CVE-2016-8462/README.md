In the January 2017 Android Security Bulletin, Google provided a patch to CVE-2016-8462, an interesting vulnerabiltiy in the Pixelsâ€™ bootloader. I reported this issue to Google last December, but unfortunately got beat by Jon Sawyer [jcase](https://twitter.com/jcase) and Sean Beaupre ([@firewaterdevs](https://twitter.com/firewaterdevs), who reported it in October, so kudos to them!

My blog post about the vuln is available [here](https://securityresear.ch/2017/01/04/fastboot-oem-sha1sum/)

Jon Sawyer uploaded his PoC to his git as well: [PixelDump](https://github.com/CunningLogic/PixelDump_CVE-2016-8462).
